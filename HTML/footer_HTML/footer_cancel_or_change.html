  <h1>Request to Cancel or Change an Order</h1>
  <p>Dear Customer ,</p>
  
  <p>We have received your request to cancel or change your order with us. We understand that circumstances may arise that necessitate modifications or cancellations, and we are here to assist you. However, before proceeding with your request, we would like to provide you with some important information to consider:</p>
  
  <h2>1. Order Status:</h2>
  <p>Please be aware that once an order is placed, it enters our system for processing and fulfillment. Therefore, the status of your order may vary depending on the time of your request. If your order has already been processed, shipped, or is in transit, cancellation or modification may not be possible.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Eligible Orders:</h2>
  <p>Not all orders may be eligible for cancellation or modification. Orders that are custom-made, personalized, or already in the final stages of fulfillment may not be eligible for changes. Additionally, orders placed during peak periods or sales events may have limited cancellation or modification options due to high order volumes and fast processing times.</p>

  <p>If you wish to cancel your order, please review our cancellation policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellation Timeframe: Requests for order cancellation must be submitted within one week of placing the order. We are unable to cancel orders beyond this specified timeframe as they may have already entered the processing or shipping stages.</li>
