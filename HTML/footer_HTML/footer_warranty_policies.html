  <h1>Warranty Policies</h1>
  <p>Thank you for choosing to shop with us. We are committed to providing you with high-quality products that meet your expectations. To ensure customer satisfaction and address any issues that may arise, we have outlined our warranty policies below.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Warranty Coverage:</h2>
  <p>We offer a warranty for eligible products that covers manufacturing defects and faulty workmanship. The warranty period and specific coverage details may vary depending on the product. Please refer to the product documentation or warranty card for the exact terms and conditions of your product's warranty.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Warranty Registration:</h2>
  <p>Some products may require warranty registration to activate the warranty coverage. It is important to complete the registration process within the specified timeframe to ensure your warranty remains valid. Failure to register your product within the designated period may result in the warranty being voided.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Warranty Claims:</h2>
  <p>If you encounter any issues covered by the warranty, please contact our customer support team as soon as possible. We will guide you through the warranty claims process, which may involve providing proof of purchase, product documentation, and a detailed description of the issue.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Warranty Exclusions:</h2>
  <p>It is important to note that our warranty does not cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Normal wear and tear resulting from product usage.</li>
    <li>Damage caused by accidents, misuse, or improper handling.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized modifications or repairs performed by third parties.</li>
    <li>Products with tampered or removed serial numbers.</li>
    <li>Issues resulting from non-compliance with product care instructions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>5. Warranty Resolution:</h2>
  <p>If your warranty claim is approved, we will provide a suitable resolution, which may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repairing the product to restore it to its proper functioning.</li>
    <li>Replacing the defective component or the entire product, depending on the nature of the issue.</li>
    <li>Issuing a refund or store credit if a repair or replacement is not feasible.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>6. Return of Defective Products:</h2>
  <p>In some cases, we may request the return of the defective product for further inspection or assessment. If a return is required, we will provide instructions and assistance in arranging the return shipment.</p>
  
  <h2>7. Non-Warranty Repairs:</h2>
  <p>If your product is no longer covered by the warranty or the issue is not covered under warranty, we may offer non-warranty repair services at an additional cost. Our customer support team will provide you with the necessary information and options for resolving the issue.</p>
